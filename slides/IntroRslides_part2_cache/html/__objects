What does this code filter for	
Filter the data for countries in Asia where lifeExp is less than 35	
Filter the data so that you only get entries where gdpPercap is equal to 1000 or less	
Filter the data for Chile Argentina Uruguay and Peru for years greater than or equal to 1992	
Filter the data to inclue data from all continents apart from Europe	
Calculate the mean_lifeExp using summarise	lifeExp_stats
Use summarise to calculate mean_lifeExp, min_lifeExp, and max_lifeExp	lifeExp_stats
Use group_by to group by country and then summarise	lifeExp_stats_country
What does the following group_by summarise code do	
Group the data by country and create two new variables which summarise the minimum and maximum pop	
Summarise maximum and Minimum population by continent and year
